when i share an item with a user an invitaion has to be sent to him and he wont be had the item in his homepage or itemdetail until he accept the invitaion. so until the user accepts the invite, the sharing has to be in "pending" status in the "shared with" box of itemdeail page. if the target user accepts it the item will be shared with him and his name will be in shared with box without any status. if he rejects it, his name and the invitation will be deleted and for the invitation sender will send a message that "{username} rejected yout invite} in the sender homepage messages box. and the message can be deleted by users choice
explain in farsi


for owner t is not shown that the sharing is pending rejectd or accepted
when a new subitem is added or any changes happens (report and deleing the item and editing the item and ...) is wont be updated in other shared users..... all things from the sahred item until the last layer ofthe subs should be shared
if an subitem is shared instead of an item the invite will be sent but it cant be accepted or rejected or if its accepted (nothing happens)
after rejection the shared will not be updated for the invitor
if a user is deleted from shared by owner, it wont be updated (deleted) for others and it wont be nested in subs for the owner too
the admin cant share the item!
invitaions dispay(name, invitor, date)


owner can be changed by the owner himself

reports:
a link of git can be shared!(optional)
who wrote the report?:
each user has a picture and a username. on left of each report in the box, it should be a thing that says who has writen this report. if user had picture, his picture should be there, of not, his username should be there
