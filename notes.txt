deleting the account
nested items
percentage in home page

item detail buttons
order switch

check the priority changes


becarfull that if any changes like in the detail of the item happened it should be applied in the home page too. now when i change the status of the item, when i come to home page the item is gone (deleted) instead of changing! but other detailes changes are applied correctly
and note that in both homepage and item detail when user drag and drop, the status of the item should be changeed based on the part that item goes in
check if these things are not handled or handled incorrect fix them
